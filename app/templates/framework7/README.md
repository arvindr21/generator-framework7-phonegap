Framework7
==========

Full Featured Mobile HTML Framework For Building iOS & Android Apps

## Getting Started
  * [Getting Started Guide](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/get-started/)
  * Clone/download this repo
  * Start building your App from changing Kitchen Sink, or from a clean template from `dist/` folder

## Server

Because Framework7 uses Ajax for navigation between pages you will need a server. So to make it work you should put dist folder (or Kitchen Sink) on a server. Or, as an option, you may use Gulp's server. Just run:

```
$ gulp server
```

  * Kitchen Sink will be available on `http://localhost:3000/kitchen-sink/`
  * Dist - on `http://localhost:3000/dist/`

## Kitchen Sink

Framework7' JS and CSS files in Kitchen Sink are temporary linked to `build/` to make development process easier on this stage. So to make it work you need to build Framework7 (see Build section) or to re-link JS and CSS files to `dist/` folder.

## Dist vs Build versions

On production use files (JS and CSS) only from `dist/` folder, there will be the most stable versions, `build/` folder is only for development purpose

## Build

Framework7 uses `gulp` to build a development (build) and dist versions.

First you need to have `gulp-cli` which you should install globally.

```
$ npm install --global gulp
```

Then install all dependencies, in repo's root:

```
$ npm install
```

And build development version of Framework7:
```
$ gulp build
```

The result is available in `build/` folder.

## Dist/Release

After you have made build:

```
$ gulp dist
```

Distributable version will available in `dist/` folder.

## Custom build

You can build custom version of Framework7 with only required components/modules. For example, if we need to include only Accordion, Modals and Tabs modules in addition to Framework 7 core: 

```
$ gulp custom -accordion,modals,tabs
```
After that you will find created `custom/` folder with generated JS and CSS files. Here is the list of available additional modules:

* cards
* accordion
* searchbar
* messages
* modals
* swipeout
* sortable
* smart-select
* virtual-list
* pull-to-refresh
* infinite-scroll
* scroll-toolbars
* tabs
* fast-clicks
* forms (means Ajax forms and forms storage)
* push-state
* swiper
* photo-browser
* picker
* calendar
* notifications

## Contributing

All changes should be commited to `src/` files. Framework7 uses LESS for CSS compliations, and concatenated JS files (look at gulpfile.js for concat files order)
